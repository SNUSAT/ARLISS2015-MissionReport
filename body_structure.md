## 2. Design focus 
---
### 2.1 Safety
- Body structure should effectively protect internal systems.
- Metal frame must be electrically insulated to prevent short circuit.
### 2.2 Assembly
- Secure sufficient space for electrical cables.
- All bolts and nuts must be perfectly assembled.
### 2.3 Aesthetic impression
### 2.4 Stability
- Mass center is supposed to be on geometric center line.
### 2.5 Cost
- Design as cheap as possible without losing safety.
### 2.6 Storage Efficiency

|SNUSAT-STR-15	|The parachute have to be decoupled from the body in 5 seconds after landing.
|SNUSAT-STR-16	|Every part should be assembled without mechanical interference
|SNUSAT-STR-16	|The Structure system should withstand over 100 ℃

### 3.2 Octangular frame
The ARLISS Cansat regulation asks the size of the satellite to be smaller than Φ146*240mm cylinder.  We have designed the body structure as a square pillar shape at first. However, for the maximum space efficiency, we invented an octagular body frame cutting off four edge of the square. This design increased internal space of the satellite without an increase in total diameter. 

### 3.3 Tap holes
A Tap hole is the female portion of the mating pair (e.g. a nut) which has screw threads. This type of hole is formed by tool named ‘tap’ and the process of cutting or forming threads using the tap is called tapping. Using the tap hole properly, we can mate parts very easily for not using nuts. We decided to use this type at the mating portion between frequent assembling parts. Therefore, we drilled tap hole on 4 holes mating between the system stack cover and body frame.

### 3.4 Reducing weights and fillets
 As all cansats for ARLISS have to be weighted under 1050g, we should design the satellite as light as possible. The satellite’s weight can be easily reduced by cutting off some portion of structural frames. We successfully decreased weight of the cansat up to 109g by removing relatively useless portions of the aluminum structures; the force flow is relatively low in the relatively useless portions. Moreover, we processed fillet at every corner of cut portion to preserve strength as much as possible.
